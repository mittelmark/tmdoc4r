## Introduction

This is a Markdown file just with a few Python code chunks.

## Hello World

```{py wait=500}
print("Hello Python World!")
```

## Variable Values

```{py}
x=1
print(x)
```

In the next code chunk we increment x:

```{py}
x=x+1
print(x)
```

## Inline code evaluation

The value of x is `py x`!

## EOF
